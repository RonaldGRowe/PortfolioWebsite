                    Used a Raspberry Pi to create a microcontroller to control and monitor environmental conditions for anything from agriculture, livestock, pets, and much more.
                    This started as a small controller that turned into quite the project. The prototype got me started with Python, Linux, and so many new programing skills and technologies.
                    The updated and current demonstrated version had its issues and new experiences that continue to add to my software developer toolkit.

            <p class="projinfo">
                Designed a C# Windows Form to log and store streaming content data for up to four users.
                Utilized multiple forms to be able to track movies, TV shows, and the unwatchable content.
                It stores whether you have watched them, want to watch, or don't want to watch.
                Autoplay always got me confused on which episode I was watching and combined with so many choices, I could not keep up with all the data.
                I was able to use text files to store the data for optimal read and save speeds for users. The download is a .exe file for Windows users.

                <p class="projinfo">
                    First off a great team experience! We created a website to display various entertainment options from movies to outdoor activities. 
                    There are always occasional issues, but they were remedied and did not prevent the team from meeting deadlines.
                    An initial version was submitted followed by a version focused on UX/UI. It was achieved using a darker theme for readability, 
                    slider feature to view more options efficiently, a header image, and an autoscrolling filmstrip feature on the homepage.

                    Created a C# Windows form that would help a church figure out how the congregation wanted to allocate their tithes. 
                    The user would input their tithe designations and submit the values to a MS Access DB. A text file was also created as a receipt.
                    This would allow the church to gather and visualize the information quickly.
                    Adding a variable to the DB statement was tricky, it just took some time to figure out the syntax.

            <p class="projinfo">
                Comparing two great programming languages by weighing the runtime differentials and the ease of using/writing the language.
                C# by far takes the runtime award with the ability to execute more tasks in a shorter amount of time. Python wins the ease of use award with a less verbose/lengthy syntax and
                so many useful modules to utilize. Funny to think some modules used to decrease Python runtimes are written in C. I enjoy writing code in Python, but the runtime factors can be a business 
                deal breaker. This is understandable and why we have so many choices when it comes to programming languages.
