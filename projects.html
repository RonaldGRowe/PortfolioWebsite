                This was a final project where I was assigned to come up with my own concept. I thought having a way to track what I was watching would be useful.
                Sometimes you forget what episode you are on, if you watched that movie, or if a show was terrible. I created a user login page so multiple users could utilize the app.
                After logging in you could choose between TV Shows, Movies, or Shows to Avoid. The most complex part was linking the mutiple form pages together and getting them to
                hide in the background when accessing different forms.

            <p>
                My group was tasked with creating a website. We could choose any subject we liked. Our group chose entertainment as it has options for
                evryone. This group project was a great lesson on teamwork. Everyone did not contribute equally but they all did contribute. The project leader was tasked
                with quite the job of making sure our deadlines would be met. We tried to improve readability and
                increase the entertainment options we were showcasing with our second version. This project was based on HTML, CSS, and jQuery.

            <h2>Tithe Keeper</h2>
            <img class="tall" src="Images/tithe-image.png" alt="Program that allows for input that tracks tithe contributions" />
            <p>
                I was tasked with creating a C# Windows Form that would help a church figure out how their congragation wanted to use their
                tithes. It was linked to a Microsoft Access database that stored and kept track of all the allocated tithes. I ran into a little trouble
                getting one of the database statements to accept a variable. The syntax was a little tricky and hard to find in the documentation.
                The program also created text files to serve as a way to double check when discrepancies appeared.
