                Hi, my name is Ronald Rowe. I'm a Software Developer based in the Southern US.<br /><br />
                After that, it is off to the computer to create efficient solutions with the power of Python and C#. With those powerful languages in my toolkit, I can solve some of
                the most challenging tasks.<br /><br />
                I like to start my day by getting caught up on the latest tech, advances in science, and current events, all coupled with a cup of coffee.<br /><br />
                I enjoy playing all types of games (card, video, board, puzzle) with my wife and kiddos. On sunny days I try to soak up some sun and enjoy nature.
                It reminds me of my younger days spent on St. Croix, USVI. Shout-out to my fellow Crucians!<br /><br />
                If your looking, you can find me expressing my point of view on the blogging platform <a href="https://medium.com/@ronaldgilesrowe" target="_blank">Medium</a>.<br /><br />
                Don't be shy. Say "Hey!" and connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronald-rowe-83a16440/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
